# 5-Gram Language Model – Edgar Allan Poe

This implements a word-level 5-gram (n=5) language model trained on texts by Edgar Allan Poe obtained from Project Gutenberg.

## Model Description
The model predicts the next word using the previous four words (5-gram). Word frequencies are used to estimate probabilities, and text is generated by sampling from the learned distributions.

## How to Run
```bash
python ngram.py
